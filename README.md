###Ransom Note Puzzle

The goal is to establish whether a given ransom note can be written with the characters available from a magazine. Obviously, the note and magazine are collections of characters (strings). You need to write a method that returns true/false to indicate whether the passed note can be written.

I've provided three attempts of my own and have added a couple more from your class. Feel free to pass along your attempt. I've implemented a rudimentary timing system to test which method is the fastest. Currently, the method that sorts the note and magazine before testing is winning by a long margin.
